Storm
=====

A programme that notifies you when a live stream begins.

Currently supports Twitch.tv and Justin.tv streams.

Run the programme and StormUrls.txt will appear in your Documents directory. Paste in the user's account page URL - e.g. http://twitch.tv/purgegamers.

Close and relaunch.

Now every 2m 30s it will poll to see if they have started streaming.

When it detects that a stream has started, a notification will pop up in the upper right of the screen accompanied by a familiar Windows noise.
